=== Agentless Scanning for Cloud Accounts

When new cloud accounts are onboarded to Prisma Cloud with the "Agentless Scanning" option enabled, scanning starts immediately. If this option is disabled before onboarding, scanning does not occur for those accounts.

When you enable agentless scanning for existing accounts in Prisma Cloud, it does not trigger an immediate scan. Instead, the account is included in the next scan cycle, which occurs every 24 hours by default.

To modify the scan cycle, see <<modifying-the-agentless-scan-interval>>
